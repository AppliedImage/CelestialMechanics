# CelestialMechanics

This repo is for storing code I built as I'm teaching myself the basics of celestial mechanics. I'd like to learn how to predict the movement of the earth relative to the sun and the earth's current location. My end goal is to be able to input current time, current date, and current location, and a desired future date and time, and get a vector pointing to where the earth will be at that time. 

I don't see much use for this, but it will be fun to solve :)
